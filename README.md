# StudentSpringRTClient

This project is intended for a thesis with its subsequent integration. This is the client part.
To run the client, you need to create an environment variables file `.env` to connect to our server. Next, you need to write the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies in your project, and at the end write the command `npm start` so that the client starts working.
